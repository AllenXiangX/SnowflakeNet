## [NEWS]


- **2022-02 [NEW:tada:]** [SPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09367), the journal extension of SnowflakeNet, is accepted to [TPAMI 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9735342). We have extended the application of snowflake point deconvolution to more generative tasks other than point cloud completion, including point cloud [auto-encoding](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/generation), [generation](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/generation), single view reconstruction ([SVR]((https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/svr))), and point cloud upsampling ([PU]((https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/PU))). This repository now contains the code of the ICCV paper and the extra contents of the extended version, including:

  - Point cloud completion on the [ShapeNet-34/21](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/completion/configs/shapenet34.yaml) dataset for [unseen class completion](https://github.com/yuxumin/PoinTr).
  - Point cloud completion on the PCN dataset evaluated under [EMD](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/completion/configs/pcn_emd.yaml) metric.
  - Point cloud auto-encoding and novel shape generation, see the [generation](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/generation) folder.
  - Single view reconstruction, seed the [svr](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/svr) folder.
  - Point cloud upsampling, see the [PU](https://github.com/AllenXiangX/SnowflakeNet/tree/main/PU) folder.

- **2021-10** [SnowflakeNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xiang_SnowflakeNet_Point_Cloud_Completion_by_Snowflake_Point_Deconvolution_With_Skip-Transformer_ICCV_2021_paper.html) is published at [ICCV 2021](https://iccv2021.thecvf.com/), and the code is released!

> Most existing point cloud completion methods suffer from the discrete nature of point clouds and the unstructured prediction of points in local regions, which makes it difficult to reveal fine local geometric details. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet
with snowflake point deconvolution (SPD) to generate complete point clouds. SPD models the generation of point clouds as the
snowflake-like growth of points, where child points are generated progressively by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our
insight into the detailed geometry is to introduce a skip-transformer in the SPD to learn the point splitting patterns that can best fit the
local regions. The skip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting patterns used in the previous SPD layer
to produce the splitting in the current layer. The locally compact and structured point clouds generated by SPD precisely reveal the
structural characteristics of the 3D shape in local patches, which enables us to predict highly detailed geometries. Moreover, since
SPD is a general operation that is not limited to completion, we explore its applications in other generative tasks, including point cloud auto-encoding, generation, single image reconstruction, and upsampling. Our experimental results outperform state-of-the-art methods
under widely used benchmarks.
